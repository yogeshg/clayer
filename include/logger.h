 * time comes (at the end of the logging command, if used properly), it'll flush

 * Record takes in instances of Prop as template parameters, and there's no way
 * to take in instances of variable types as template parameters (no template
 * for template parameters) as of yet (If Prop were a concept, props would have
 * to be a list of types). A similar problem necessitates puting Stream as an
 * explicit template parameter. This would be resolved by a proposal approved
 * for C++17 to be implemented in GCC 7 [1].
